In the year 20XX, As global oil supplies dwindle, prices skyrocket, threatening global
                        economic depression. The world's major powers race to secure the remaining reserves, igniting
                        old rivalries. China and Russia ally against the United States, European Union and India, while
                        the emerging Islamic State uses the crisis to sweep to power across North Africa and the Middle
                        East. Oil Wars takes place in an "alternate universe" where the people of the world fail to come
                        together to solve the energy crisis. The content of this game is not meant to reflect any existing
                        political or military reality, it is purely a work of fiction. It is my hope the people of the
                        world will come together to protect and preserve the planet and the human race, especially the
                        elimination of radioactive, poisonous and biological warfare, which thereaten the innocent, future
                        generations to whom we all hope to leave a better world; who we hope will be more just, wise
                        peaceful and prosperous than ourselves.<br>
